### Head-Fixed mice
Micro-fiber array approach capable of chronically measuring and optogenetically manipulating local dynamics across over 100 targeted locations simultaneously in head-fixed and freely moving mice, enabling investigation of cell-type and neurotransmitter-specific signals over arbitrary 3-D volumes . This protocol includes the steps for imaging in freely-moving mice.

 Injections to target midbrain DA neurons for the dual-wavelength recordings (Figure S2C) were performed 3.07mm caudal to the bregma at four sites: ML = 0.5mm, DV =-4.00 mm and -4.25 mm, ML = 1mm, DV = -4.125mm and ML = 1.5 mm, DV = -3.8 mm below the dura, 200-400nL at each site at a rate âˆ¼ 100 nL/min.

Injections were targeted to the midbrain for the stimulation experiment (Figure 6) at 4 sites relative to bregma: AP = -3.05, ML = 0.6, DV = -4.6 and DV = -4.25; AP = -3.5, ML = 1.25, DV = -3.9 and DV = -4.5.
