      - name: FiberArray
        description: The optical fiber used in a multi-fiber arrays configuration, fabricated in-house to enable large scale measurements across deep brain volumes.
          Bare fibers were cut into pieces (ca. 3cm) then mounted under a microscope into 55-60μm diameter holes in a custom 3D printed grid (3mm W x 5mm L, Boston Micro Fabrication),
          measured under a dissection microscope to target a particular depth beneath the grid, and secured in place with UV glue (Norland Optical Adhesive 61).
          Each array contained between 30 and 103 fibers separated by a minimum of 220μm radially and 250μm axially.
          Separation was calculated to achieve maximal coverage of the striatum volume with no overlap in the collection fields of individual fibers.
          Fibers were cut with a fiber scribe, and the distal ends were inspected to ensure a uniform cut, and re-cut as necessary.
          Distal ends were then glued inside an 1cm ca. section of polyimide tube (0.8-1.3mm diameter, MicroLumen) then cut with a fresh razorblade.
          The bundled fibers inside the tube were then polished on fine grained polishing paper (ThorLabs,polished first with 6 μm, followed by 3 μm) to create a smooth,
          uniform fiber bundle surface for imaging.
          A larger diameter post was mounted on one side of the plastic grid to facilitate holding during implantation.

         Blue excitation light (470 nm LED, Thorlabs, No. SOLIS-470C) and violet excitation light (for the isosbestic control)
         were coupled into the optic fiber such that a power of 0.75 mW was delivered to the fiber tip.
         Then, 470 nm and 405 nm excitation were alternated at 100 Hz using a waveform generator,
         each filtered with a corresponding filter.
