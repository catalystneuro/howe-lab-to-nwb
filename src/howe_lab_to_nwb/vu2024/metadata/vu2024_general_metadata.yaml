    Neural population dynamics relevant to behavior vary over multiple spatial and temporal scales across
    three-dimensional volumes. Current optical approaches lack the spatial coverage and resolution necessary to measure
    and manipulate naturally occurring patterns of large-scale, distributed dynamics within and across deep brain
    regions such as the striatum. We designed a new micro-fiber array approach capable of chronically measuring and
    optogenetically manipulating local dynamics across over 100 targeted locations simultaneously in head-fixed and
    freely moving mice, enabling the investigation of cell-type- and neurotransmitter-specific signals over arbitrary
    3D volumes at a spatial resolution and coverage previously inaccessible. We applied this method to resolve rapid
    dopamine release dynamics across the striatum, revealing distinct, modality-specific spatiotemporal patterns in
    response to salient sensory stimuli extending over millimeters of tissue. Targeted optogenetics enabled flexible
    control of neural signaling on multiple spatial scales, better matching endogenous signaling patterns, and the
    spatial localization of behavioral function across large circuits.
  session_description: |
    This dataset contains fiber photometry recordings from multi-fiber arrays implanted in the striatum in mice running
    on a treadmill while receiving either visual (blue LED) or auditory (12 kHz tone) stimuli at random intervals (4–40 s).
    Some sessions may include water reward delivery, where a water spout mounted on a post delivered water rewards (9 μL) at random time intervals (randomly drawn from a 5-30s uniform distribution) through a water spout and solenoid valve gated electronically.
    Licking was monitored by a capacitive touch circuit connected to the spout.

   Mice were anesthetized under isoflurane (1-3%) and placed in a stereotaxic frame.
   A large craniotomy was performed with a surgical drill (Midwest Tradition 790044, Avtec Dental RMWT) to expose the
   cortical surface above the striatum. Mice were injected with AAVs to express genetically encoded proteins for
   optical measurements and manipulations. Virus (~200-800nL per site) was injected stereotaxically through a
   pulled glass pipette (diameter 30-50µm) at a rate of ~100nL/min. For striatum expression, virus was injected at
   10-40 total locations chosen to maximize overlap with fiber positions. For midbrain targeting, for one set of mice,
   we injected the 4 sites relative to bregma: AP = -3.05, ML = 0.6, DV = -4.6 and DV = -4.25; AP = -3.5, ML = 1.25,
   DV = -3.9 and DV = -4.5. For a midbrain targeting in another set of mice, we injected at 3.07mm caudal to the bregma
   at 4 sites: ML = 0.5mm, DV =-4.00 mm and -4.25 mm, ML = 1mm, DV = -4.125mm and ML = 1.5 mm, DV = -3.8 mm below the dura.
